                            <p>Robo-advisors are certainly efficient in providing first time and / or starting investors with a cost effective entry to the market, utilising proven asset allocation and risk assessment methodology in creating solutions.</p>
                            <p>However, there is a limit to their service offering. As I have outlined in the sections below.</p>
                            <h3>Planners Act As A Coach</h3>
                            <p>One of the main problems is that in most cases investors are risk averse and due to this will fall in a lower yielding portfolio based on algorithm allocations. This can lead to detrimental effects on long-term returns.</p>
                            <p>A professional advisor will find a balance in risk application and push the client to a point where sufficient returns are generated as they incorporate inflation risk equally in the risk evaluation equation. Also, a professional advisor can coach a client through tough market times and times of high volatility ensuring they do not sell at the wrong time or apply emotion to their decision-making.</p>
                            <h3>Planners Have A Broader Purview</h3>
                            <p>Professional advisors also assist in fiduciary (trust and legacy) planning as well as international and local tax efficiency, utilising structuring that is too complex for algorithms to apply on a mass-volume base. Also, professional advisors can provide services relating to wills and estate administration.</p>
                            <p>Professional advisors with vast offshore experience can also assist in protecting clients from regulatory and tax pitfalls, again not possible through robo-advisors. This is an increasing risk as most investors who hold equity in the US will attest to.</p>
                            <p>Clients are individuals and have specific requirements. In an industry that is highly regulated with legislation and regulations affecting every move an investor makes, robo-advisors will in my view not be able to provide complex solutions and enhanced yields based on investment planning AND structuring.</p>
                            <h3>Planners Are Not Necessarily Much More Expensive</h3>
                            <p>It is my opinion that full transparency is already in place in the advisory industry when we talk about professional advisors. Our clients know exactly what they are paying.</p>
                            <p>The cost benefit for a robo-advisor is at most 0.5%, based on my firm’s solutions and from the discussion points above I feel comfortable that the slightly higher fee is justified.</p>
                            <h3>Overall</h3>
                            <p>We definitely feel that robo-advisors are here to stay and have their part to play in assisting individuals in creating wealth but there is no threat to our business model and client base as our clients require human and expert intervention.</p>
                            <p>Ultimately, a family managed by a professional advisor is in a fortunate position of having a one-stop shop. The advisor will manage all administration regarding investments, retirement and death. They will assist in short term insurance, assurance, business insurance, business and personal finance strategy and in sourcing financing for personal and business needs. Algorithms cannot provide such a wide and varied service offering.</p>
