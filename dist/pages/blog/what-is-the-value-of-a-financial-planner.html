<p>Many people are not exactly sure what a financial planner actually does and the sad truth is that they don't always have the best reputation in South Africa. However, financial planners should be doing a lot for you and, with regulatory changes in motion, it is becoming easier to avoid those who do not have your best interests at heart.</p>
	<p>So, you ask "What does a financial planner actually do for me?"</p>
	<p>We've put together a quick guide that helps to explain.</p>
	<p>If you are pushed for time and don't want to read the whole article, the headlines are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Planners can tailor a comprehensive and holistic financial plan for you, save you time and stress, grow your assets and guard against unnecessary wealth leakages.</li>
		<li>Their monetary value add is estimated to be around 1.8% per year compared to managing your money yourself.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Still with us? Great, lets dive into it.</p>
	<h3>They Make a Comprehensive Plan</h3>
	<p>Your first sessions with a financial planner should focus on defining what your goals are. For example, you might want to retire at 55, or go on that round-the-world trip you've always dreamed of, in the next five years. Financial goals can and should have different time horizons, with 1 year, 5 year and long term goals requiring different financial tools.</p>
    <p>With your goals laid out, it's now time to work out how you're going to achieve them from a financial point of view. A planner will conduct an assessment of where you currently are and then make a detailed plan of what you need to do to reach your goals. For example, how much do you need to save a month and what should you do with the money that you save?</p> 
    <p>So, you ask, what are the benefits of this? What is in it for me?</p>
    <p>Firstly, you should not underestimate how useful it is to have clear goals and a roadmap of how to achieve them. It helps you to remain disciplined and focused whilst the world swirls madly around you.</p> 
    <p>Secondly, a financial planner has knowledge of all the tools that you can use to reach your goals. Quality planners will know how to best mix together investments, insurance, tax and legal structures to help you reach your goals. You might know about one or two of the potential tools, but knowing about all of them and how to best use them together can be extremely valuable.</p>
	
    <h3>They Save You Time and Stress</h3>
    <p>There is no doubt that managing money is time consuming and stressful! That's why there are professionals to help you do it. Understanding the different options out there, comparing performance and obtaining quotes from different providers takes a huge amount of time and effort. We're sure you would be able to spend that time more effectively!</p> 
    <p>A financial planner can significantly shorten this process. It only takes 2-3 initial meetings and a review every year (of course, you can opt for more regular meetings if you'd prefer).</p>
    
    <h3>They Grow Your Assets In-line With Your Needs</h3>
    <p>Financial planners have a deep understanding of both your needs and the different financial products available. This is a powerful mix, meaning that planners can match products to your requirements.</p>
    <p> They can put your money in quality products that will allow you to <strong>access the money when you need it</strong>. It is no good placing your life savings in a product with great returns that can only be accessed once you retire if you intend to buy your dream house in six months' time.</p> 
    <p>There is some debate over whether planners achieve higher returns on investments than individual investors; some studies put financial planners ahead and others individual investors. Whilst this debate will rage on, there are two things that you should bear in mind:</p>
	<ol>
		<ol>
			<li>Investing without a solid understanding of how the stock market works is precarious. If you don't have the appetite for learning about the details of investing, be <strong>very</strong> careful before making a decision that you may regret.</li>
			<li>The real value of a planner is not in picking the best unit trust in South Africa. Instead, it is their ability to provide a holistic plan, which you can stick to, that will make sure that your money grows in a way that is aligned to your needs.</li>
		</ol>
	</ol>
    
	<h3>They Guard Against Unnecessary Losses</h3>
	<p>Changes in wealth, by definition, come from either asset growth or the loss of assets. And it is perhaps the latter (avoiding it!) that a planner will help you with the most. Financial planners typically help you avoid unnecessary losses through two mechanisms:</p> 
    <p><em><strong>Tax Efficiency</strong></em><br /> A deep understanding of current tax rules helps you to make sure that you are not overpaying. For example, my Mum was recently going to cash out her pension fund to purchase a buy-to-let property. The numbers looked good and she was ready to sign.</p> 
    <p> Almost as an afterthought she consulted a financial planner before signing. They showed how the tax bill created by withdrawing from the pension fund would far outweigh any returns from the property itself. Needless to say that she didn't go ahead with the purchase.</p> 
    <p><em><strong>Withdrawal Efficiency</strong></em><br /> Putting money into savings products is great, but you also want to be able to take it out! This is especially important during retirement, when you will probably be funding yourself through withdrawals from your savings.</p> 
    <p> When and how much to take out can be a tricky decision and if you get it wrong it can lose you a lot of potential growth. For example, if the stock market has just taken a tumble you might want to withdraw less from your savings this year and a bit more once the market picks up again. Financial planners should have their finger on the pulse of the markets and will be able to adjust your withdrawal schedule dynamically.</p>
	
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
	<p>So, when all is said and done how much is a planner worth?</p> 
    <p> Well, the answer is: 1.82% more in asset growth per year compared to doing it yourself. Well at least that is what a <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/are-financial-advisers-worth-their-fee-2012-09-26" class="blogexcerpt-link" target="_blank">study</a> by Morningstar in the US found. Bear in mind that this only focuses on the monetary value of a planner, not the emotional and time aspect. Remember that planners also save you time and stress.</p> 
    <p> It is also important to note that this is an average figure. If your planner is not as experienced it may be lower and if they are better than their peers it should be higher.</p>
