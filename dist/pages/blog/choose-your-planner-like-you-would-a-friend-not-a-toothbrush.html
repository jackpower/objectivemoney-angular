                                <p>After our <a href="#!/how-to-ensure-your-planners-not-a-scammer" class="blogexcerpt-link" target="_blank">last post</a> detailed how to ensure that your planner's not a scammer, we'd like to move on to some of the other aspects of choosing the right planner for you, what we like to call the 'softer' side of planners or the 'it'.</p>
	<p>If you're pressed for time, the most important takeaway from this post is:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>It is critical to consider the softer aspects of whether a planner is right for <strong>you</strong>.</li>
		<li>E.g. is their personality a good fit, do they work in your local area or do you mind if they outsource some of their services.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Often planners can be really good at what they do but that is not always enough; you need to like them, trust them and be able to connect with them. After all they will know all your deepest, darkest secrets!</p>
	<p>Anyway, let's jump in.</p>
	<p>Your planner needs to act as your guide, friend, confidante and adviser, all rolled into one. It is crucial to check him/her out before you sign up to anything.</p>
	<h3>References</h3>
	<p>It is crucial to do some research on your planner. And the best way to do this is to get references from previous or current clients who have dealt with the planner in the past.</p>
	<p>Read as many reviews as possible to try to get a good sense of the planner's personality and skill. Understanding what experiences clients have had of a planner in the past is critical to your decision on whether to move forward with them.</p>
	<p>Naturally some reviews will be extremely positive or extremely negative. Try to get a sense of the general view - which themes, words or associations come up frequently?</p>
	<h3>Services</h3>
	<p>It is also worth checking whether the planner offers all of their services in-house, or whether they outsource any functions to a third party. Delivering services in-house means that the planner (or his/her team) takes care of actually doing the work themselves, instead of outsourcing it to a third-party.</p>
	<p>Whilst outsourced servicing should not be a deal breaker, it is generally better if it is done in-house as it means that planners are more involved in the processes and can ensure better quality on an ongoing basis.</p>
	<h3>Location</h3>
	<p>You will want to see your financial planner on a fairly regular basis. You should certainly see them for an annual review and probably at least once in the interim. Given this, it is important that you don't have to travel too far to see them.</p>
	<p>Most planners will be happy to travel to you, as long as you are within a reasonable distance from them. If they only hold meetings at their offices then just check on Google Maps how long it will take you to get to their offices.</p>
	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
	<p>So: it is critical to ensure that the planner you select is the right fit for you. A financial planner is not a toothbrush - he/she needs to be your guide during both good and bad times and you need to trust them.</p>
	<p>Having discussed the softer/fit aspects of the planner in this post, look for our next posts focusing on the 'harder' metrics such as fees (!).</p>
	<p>Also, we will soon be incorporating these softer metrics into the planner profiles on our site. So if you are looking for a planner and want some Objective reviews, <a href="#!/" class="blogexcerpt-link" target="_blank">visit us</a> to see our progress.</p><!--Update based on post-->
