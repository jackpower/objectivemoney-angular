## Description

A grunt task that adds your `package.json` revision at the end of your file name. This can be used for staying organized
and/or cache busting.

**This task renames files, so suggested use is in a temp or dist directory... not in the dev directory!**

This task can be combined nicely with [`grunt-bump`](https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-bump) and can be run before or
after [minification](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-uglify) depending on where you want the
`.min` to end up.

This is a multi task.

## Usage

Example usage in grunt init:

```javascript
    revPackage: {
        example1: 'temp/scripts/**/*.js',
        example2: 'temp/js/*.js'
    },
```

If your `package.json.version` is `0.1.0` then the following file

    /temp/scripts/file.js

would be changed to:

    /temp/scripts/file.0.1.0.js

`example1` would affect all js files in `temp/scripts` and all subdirectories. `example2` would only affect files in
`temp/js` and not subdirectories. This second version is useful if you - for example - have a `vendor` sub directory
that you wish to remain untouched.

## Installation and Use

To use this package, put it as a dependency in your `package.json`, and then run `npm install`.

Load the grunt task in your `grunt.js`

```javascript
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-rev-package');
```

## Tests

Tests can be run from teh `grunt-rev-package` directory using:

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

You can inspect the sample output created. The tests can be run by either cloning the git repo or from this module's
directory inside the `node_modules` folder of your project.
