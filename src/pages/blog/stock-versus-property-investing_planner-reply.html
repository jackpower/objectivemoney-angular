                        <br>
                        <p>One should keep in mind that there are a lot of expenses in purchasing and running a property which is not the case with equity. For example, the following costs can be expected when purchasing / selling a property:</p>
                        <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Transfer duty;</li>
                                <li>Lawyer fees;</li>
                                <li>Valuation fees;</li>
                                <li>Estate agent fees of between 5% to 10%;</li>
                                <li>Electrical and other certificates at sale.</li>
                            </ul>    
                        </p>
                        <p>This could lead to an expense of between 5% to 15% of the property value at purchase (an upfront expense) AND AGAIN at sale! That is 10% to 30% expense in total of the property value. Trying to catch up with such a high initial and exit expense is not easy, especially with property yields.</p>
                        <p>On an annual basis the expected expenses are:</p>
                        <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Levies;</li>
                                <li>Rates and Taxes;</li>
                                <li>Maintenance (usually about 0.5% to 1% per annum of the property value, more if the unit is rented out).</li>
                            </ul>    
                        </p>
                    <p>Direct property yields are usually 6% to 10% of the value of the property per annum. But after expenses it is below inflation most of the time. Carrying such a risky asset (a single property in a single suburb or zone, in a single city and in a single country) at return levels below inflation after cost is absolutely nonsensical.</p>
                    <p>Instead of holding property directly investors can look at equity and listed property holdings (shares, trusts and REITS), which do not carry these type of expenses. Also, listed property investments such as property shares, trusts and REITS provide wide diversification in terms of geography (local and offshore) and industry (residential, industrial, commercial, retail and office). Holding listed property, instead of direct property, can also help to mitigate the liquidity risk that was outlined in the main article.</p>
                    <p>Quite a few of our REITS and listed property shares are included in world indexes, providing price support through index trackers being forced to purchase these shares and REITS. Again, supporting liquidity and value. This is not the case with directly held property.</p>
                    <p>It is understandable that people find comfort in holding a physical asset, such as property, as the asset is a physical structure that the client can access. However, most of the time this is to the detriment of their returns.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the leveraging of a property. It is a dangerous thing to do and people need to understand the risks involved in doing so. Investors can also leverage their shareholding to access more shares but again this is very risky, just as with leveraging your property and people need to fully understand the risks and processes involved.</p>
                    <p>We see direct property holding more as a lifestyle asset than an investment asset. But if you understand the asset class fully and carry deep knowledge of the sector and the business of managing and owning property, it can be a beneficial asset class to hold. With deep knowledge, we are talking about commercial property experts who have been in the industry for many a year.</p>
                    <p>Holding property is administratively and time intensive. You can obtain the same and better yields with no input at all by applying balanced investment portfolio and at far lower costs.</p>
                    <p>Follow the Warren Buffet principle, if you do not understand what you are investing in, DO NOT INVEST.</p>
