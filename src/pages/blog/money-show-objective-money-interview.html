                            <p><b>Bruce Whitfield (Host of 702’s Money Show):</b> Onto our first Friday File, it is a story about financial planning and it’s not nearly as deadly dull as you might think.</p>
                        <p>How do you get financial planning to be more relevant? How do you get to meet a financial planner in the first place?</p>
                        <p>If you have ever used Trip Advisor, you will know that it is actually quite an effective way of assessing whether or not a destination, or a property or a restaurant is suited to you. You read through comments of other people, you go to the place, you make your own remarks and pretty soon you get a feel for how it all works.</p>
                        <p>Well, this is Trip Advisor for financial planners.</p>
                        <p>One of the most common requests I get on the radio is to recommend a financial planner to lots of different people. And it’s not something I can do, certainly not ethically and even if I wanted to I would hate to be held responsible for you making a bad money decision on the advice of somebody that I put you in touch with.</p>
                        <p>So that is why I am thrilled to meet Jack Power, the founder of Objective Money. It is a start-up website that will allow you to search through customer reviewed financial planners in your local area. Jack Power, founder of Objective Money, where did the idea come from?</p>
                        <p><b>Jack Power (Founder of Objective Money):</b> Hi Bruce, thanks for having me on the show. So the idea came actually from a personal struggle I had. I was looking for a financial planner myself, I went online and frankly was shocked at how useless the information I found online was. Financial planner’s websites tend to be very bland and talk about similar things.</p>
                        <p>So I got to start thinking about how can I actually improve this for everyone else, and for myself. And then I decided that the Trip Advisor model could be a really interesting thing to apply to the financial planning industry.</p>
                        <p>I spoke to a few planners and got really good feedback and, of course, to a few people looking for planners and they described how useful it would be. And that was the genesis of Objective Money.</p>
                        <p><b>Bruce:</b> Oh ok, have you done anything like this before?</p>
                        <p><b>Jack:</b> No, actually my background was in strategy consulting. I took a break from strategy consulting about four months ago to really try and develop the Objective Money platform. So not really in the technology, or at least web development space before. It is a really exciting time for me.</p>
                        <p><b>Bruce:</b> But have you done big data analytics in the past? This is what this is all about, isn’t it?</p>
                        <p><b>Jack:</b> I did actually help to build a big data team back in the UK, where I am originally from. We essentially focused on the healthcare industry. So how can use healthcare data that is generated in droves, in hospitals etc., to improve the healthcare delivery within a Local Health Economy.</p>
                        <p><b>Bruce:</b> Ok. So if I live in Bloemfontein, you should be able to match me up with some financial advisors in Bloemfontein and give them a rating based on what other peoples experience are of those financial planners as easily as if I lived in Sandton or Claremont in Cape Town?</p>
                        <p><b>Jack:</b> At the moment we are still an early stage business. We have been running for about four months. In terms of our planner footprint we are very much focused in Johannesburg region at the moment. But we are expanding very quickly. We actually have a couple of planners who are looking to sign up, within the Bloemfontein area, in the next week. So hopefully we will able to serve Bloemfontein soon.</p>
                        <p><b>Bruce:</b> Oh ok. How do you get people to participate? Do they have to pay to participate?</p>
                        <p>Eventually you have to make some money out of this yourself.</p>
                        <p><b>Jack:</b> In terms of participation, we contact planners and describe our business and typically get a very good response.</p>
                        <p>We do charge planners for being on the platform. It isn’t a subscription service, so planners don’t just pay for being there; they actually pay for the business that is generated through the site. We are entirely driven by making it as easy as possible for people to find great planners.</p>
                        <p><b>Bruce:</b> Now. There are a couple of shortcomings here. Because if you are a lousy planner you are not going to agree to be on the service and if you are a great planner who gets two or three lousy reviews that effects peoples perspective of you, you are likely to opt out. Aren’t you?</p>
                        <p><b>Jack:</b> I think that in terms of lousy planners it is not a bad thing not to have lousy planners on our platform. That is actually what is quite nice about the review system, it is self regulating in terms of bad planners dropping out, which is a good thing for people looking for planners.</p>
                        <p>In terms of good planners who have bad reviews. We encourage planners when they come onto the platform to get existing customers to leave a review of them. So that they have reviews of people who have already used them when they sign up. So, if you are a good planner you should have good reviews already.</p>
                        <p><b>Bruce:</b> Oh right, so when you use Trip Advisor you say nice hotel, lovely comfortable rooms, good room service, friendly staff and you get twenty good reasons and then suddenly someone has had a bad experience because they have slipped on a banana peel on the street outside. Then you go oh no, it’s a bad part of town; I am not going to go there. There is that risk isn’t there of that sort of equilibrium. We tend to regard negativity far more strongly than we regard positivity, don’t we?</p>
                        <p><b>Jack:</b> Absolutely, if you look at how people use Trip Advisor or Amazon they always look at the average rating and they look at the one star review. That is typically what happens.</p>
                        <p>We do ask people to explain why they have given a certain rating. If you haven’t given a good review you have to say why. So if it was that, I don’t know, I tripped on banana on the way to see planner X, then it would be there for people to see.</p>
                        <p>We can also follow up with the client as well to understand more about the review that they have given.</p>
                        <p><b>Bruce:</b> What sort of questions do you ask in the review process? Because many people going into the environment of a financial planner are maybe quite nervous, intimidated, feel a bit thick. They may or may not act on the advice they are given, so how do you then get to this very grand title that you are calling yourself of, Objective Money.</p>
                        <p><b>Jack:</b> We ask along four criteria. We ask that they give an overall rating in terms of a one to five star rating. We also ask that they describe their overall experience with a planner, what services they were provided with and then what the planner did well and what they could have done better.</p>
                        <p>In terms of Objective Money, the name comes around from us trying to be as objective as possible. Our platform is transparent in how planners are displayed and also a way for a customer to have their view on a planner.</p>
                        <p><b>Bruce:</b> Now at some point these sites tend to work really well, they become aggregators of information and then one day a financial planning company says: you know what I would like to pay you one hundred thousand rand a month to advertise a banner on the top of your site. There is a huge temptation to accept the advertising money, but then you are no longer Objective Money.</p>
                        <p><b>Jack:</b> Absolutely. If you look at other models around the world that do similar things [to us], you will see that they often have a featured advisor. A certain advisor who has paid, I don’t know, an extra one hundred rand to be top of the rankings.</p>
                        <p>We don’t do that, I mean we just don’t do that. It is not ethos of our company, we made a decision early on that we are not going to have that in our model.</p>
                        <p><b>Bruce:</b> Roland VG makes the point on my twitter account saying ‘Trip Advisor had people rating their own hotels under fake profiles’. How do you keep it honest?</p>
                        <p><b>Jack:</b> We actually have security built into the review system; you can do some interesting things in terms of the analytics behind it. You can flag suspicious reviews in terms of the words people use and compare them to other reviews given, in terms of the IP addresses when people are leaving reviews you can easily see if it just one computer putting in reviews and then we also follow up via email with people who have left reviews just to make sure that it was them.</p>
                        <p><b>Bruce:</b> There we go. Glen asks ‘are you allowed to include what the financial planner extorts, I mean charges, per hour’. Glen is terribly cynical when it comes to anything to do with other people’s money. So do you put pricing up there? Do you put that sort of detail or is it purely the experience of the planning process?</p>
                        <p><b>Jack:</b> At the moment we don’t have pricing explicitly up there. One of the reasons for that is that in the current structure of how financial planners are paid through commissions etc it is actually very difficult to put a single number on how much it would cost for a planner.</p>
                        <p>In my personal view the upcoming regulation in terms of RDR [Retail Distribution Review] will be a positive thing. Reducing the reliance on commissions and making it a much more fee based structure.</p>
                        <p>The other thing is that if you look at the industry standards, once you go outside of the very heavily commissions driven planners, you find that it is pretty standard at about 1 percentage of assets under management.  That’s the average and it would decrease if you had a very large lump sum.</p>
                        <p><b>Bruce:</b> Jack Power, we wish you luck with it. I certainly hope that it works, the founder of Objective Money. It is where financial planning and Trip Advisor effectively meet. It is the Trip Advisor of financial planning. In the same way that you might rate your Uber driver and your Uber driver rates you after going on the ride, you get to rate the financial planner. And give advice and either add a huge amount of support for an advisor or warn others against them.</p>
