                    <div class="blogexcerpt-excerpt-body">
                        <p>Did you know that 90% of all of the data in the world has been created in the last few years? The rise of the internet and the associated glut of information has been dubbed the big-data revolution. But what can we learn from this data about the humble financial planner?</p>
                        <p>We had a look at Google's search engine and twitter's social media datasets and found six interesting facts.</p>
                        <h3>1)	There are 1,500 Google searches in South Africa for financial planners every month</h3>
                    <p>Globally there are roughly 100,000 searches a month, with South Africa accounting for 1.5% of these.</p>
                        <h3>2)	South Africans are 3 times more likely to search for financial planners compared to the rest of the world</h3>
                        <p>South Africa only accounts for 0.56% of global GDP, but accounted for 1.5% of all searches.</p>
                        <p>This over index cannot be explained by the wealth of the average South African, with GDP per Capita in South Africa only 48% of the global average.</p>
                        <h3>3)	People are much more likely to search for a financial planner between March to July</h3>
                                                <p>The volume of searches for financial planners / advisors is incredibly seasonable. There is a substantial uptick in searches between March and July, with December being a particularly slow month.</p>
                                                <p>You can see the seasonal changes, in South Africa and globally through the chart below:</p>
                                        <div class="blogImg">
                                        <img class="img-responsive" ng-src='img/blogphotos/Google_Searches_For_Financial_Planner_vs_Average_Number_Per_Month.png'></img>
                                        </div>
                                                <p>As you can see, there is a huge drop off between July and December in South Africa, which is not mirrored by the rest of the world.</p>
                        <h3>4)	Increasingly people are searching for ‘financial advisor’ rather than ‘financial planner’</h3>
                        <p>72% of searches were for ‘financial advisor’, with only 22% for ‘financial planner’.</p>
                        <p>Interestingly, there has been a steep decline in the number of searches for ‘financial planner’ (globally and in South Africa).  Between 2011-15 the volume of searches for ‘financial planner’ decreased by 34%, whereas searches for ‘financial advisor’ increased by 10%.</p>
                        <h3>5)	People are generally positive about financial planners, but slightly less so about financial advisors</h3>
                        <p>Analysing sentiment data on the web, particularly within social media we can see that most people are positive about financial planners / advisors. On average, for every negative comment there are 1.8 positive comments.</p>
                        <p>Interestingly, the term financial planner is 30% more likely to be associated with positive sentiment compared to the term financial advisor.</p>
                        <h3>6)	70% of all searches are by customers looking for advice, the other 30% are by planners looking for jobs or materials</h3>
                        <p>Examining the words used in these searches we see that 70% are by individuals looking for advice, with the other 30% of searches looking for jobs or information on training etc.</p>
                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p>Thinking about these results the first thing that should strike you is that people in South Africa are certainly using the internet as a way to gather information about financial planners.</p>
                        <p>As such, it is critical that people can find quality information and guidance from online sources. I suppose that helps to justify our existence!</p>
                        <p>Looking at the seasonality of searches it is clear that South Africa diverges hugely from the rest of the world. Perhaps the key message we can take away from this is to encourage people to maintain financial management in the summer as well as the winter!</p>
                        <p>Looking at the terminology used, the rise of the financial advisor could be seen as somewhat concerning. It is our belief that people get the best results when financial managers work as long-term planners, rather than ad-hoc advisors <a href="//www.objectivemoney.co.za/#/what-is-the-value-of-a-financial-planner" class="blogexcerpt-link" target="_blank">(see this post for more information)</a>. We can also see some support for this based on the less positive sentiment on social media associated with advisors versus planners. With people increasingly discounting planners over advisors, you could see a number of people not getting the most out of the services they purchase.</p>
