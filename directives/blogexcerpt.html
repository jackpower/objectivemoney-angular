        <p>After explaining in our last post that a planner is not a toothbrush (in any way, shape or form!), we'd like to move on to one of the most important aspects of choosing a planner – the fees. How much will you pay for the planner’s time, efforts and advice?</p>

        <p>After our <a href="#/how-to-ensure-your-planners-not-a-scammer">last post</a> detailed how to ensure that your planner's not a scammer, we'd like to move on to some of the other aspects of choosing the right planner for you, what we like to call the 'softer' side of planners or the 'fit'.</p>
	<p>If you're pressed for time, the most important takeaway from this post is:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>It is critical to consider the softer aspects of whether a planner is right for <strong>you</strong>.</li>
		<li>E.g. is their personality a good fit, do they work in your local area or do you mind if they outsource some of their services.</li>

        <p>After introducing the concept of a financial planner in our last post, we’d like to focus on a serious FAQ – can I be sure that my planner won’t mislead me, or worse, steal my hard-earned cash.</p>
    <p>If you are pressed for time, the main takeaway from this post is:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>DON’T DEAL WITH A PLANNER THAT DOES NOT HOLD A FAIS LICENSE.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Got that? Let’s get into it.</p>

        <p>Many people are not exactly sure what a financial planner actually does and the sad truth is that they don't always have the best reputation in South Africa. However, financial planners should be doing a lot for you and, with regulatory changes in motion, it is becoming easier to avoid those who do not have your best interests at heart.</p>
	<p>So, you ask 'What does a financial planner actually do for me?'.</p>
	<p>We've put together a quick guide that helps to explain.</p>
