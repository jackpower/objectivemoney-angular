                        <p>In the last few years robo-advise has been one of the hottest topics in the financial press. It is surrounded by much hype and as it starts to move out of its start-up, jeans and t-shirt phase it is worth taking stock. This article explores what robo-advise is, what its merits are and whether it really will put the sword to the traditional financial planning industry.

                        To the best of our knowledge there are currently no robo-advisor companies operating in South Africa. However, it will not be long before they start to spring up here. Some of the biggest companies in the space have already indicated that they are currently looking to expand internationally. 

                        For now the discussion below may only arm you with material for dinner party conversations, however it will very soon become important to know.
                        </p>
                        <h2>What Is Robo-Advise?</h2>
                        <h3>What Defines Robo-Advise?</h3>
                        <p>To coin Wikipedia:</p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>Robo-advisors are a class of financial adviser that provides portfolio management online with minimal human intervention</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>This means that a robo-advisor will use algorithms to automatically choose your investments and will use computer software to maintain your investments.</p>
                        <p>As the definition states they have minimal human intervention, practically meaning that they operate almost exclusively online and you have no opportunity to consult an individual planner.</p>
                        <h3>How Do You Use Robo-Advise?</h3>
                        <p>You sign up to your chosen site and it will start by asking you a few questions about your goals and risk appetite. Based on your responses it will create an investment portfolio that it determines to be the best match to your requirements.</p>
                        <p>If you want to see a typical registration process in action you can simulate signing up with Hedgeable, a US based robo-advisor, <a href="//www.hedgeable.com/getstarted" class="blogexcerpt-link" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
                        <h3>Have The Machines Already Taken Over?</h3>
                        <p>The robo-advise industry has grown rapidly, albeit from a small base. According to a study by Consumer Insight, between April-June 2014 the total Assets Under Management of robo-advisors grew by 37%.</p>
                        <p>Some forward-looking studies are anticipating maintained robust growth, with a recent A.T. Kearney report estimating that the industry could be worth $2.2 trillion by 2020. But having worked on reports such as these in the past I would take the forecasts with a generous pinch of salt.</p>
                        <p>However, don’t get too caught up in the growth numbers. The robo-advise market only accounts for a tiny proportion of the total investment management market, roughly 0.2%. </p>
                        <h2>What Are The Advantages Of Robo-Advise?</h2>
                        <h3>Very Low Fees</h3>
                        <p>The main advantage of robo-advisors is their low fees. Fees range from free (with paid for add-ons) to 0.5% per annum of the assets they manage. This is much less than the typical 1% per annum of assets under management that a financial planner would traditionally charge.</p>
                        <p>Typically, robo-advisors also charge platform fees. These are the fees that must be paid to the provider of the investment products that they use. At about 0.3% per annum, these tend to be similar to those of a traditional financial planner.</p>
                        <h3>Extremely Transparent</h3>
                        <p>Robo-advisors are generally very transparent. They provide user-friendly, up-to-date portals where you can easily see where your money is and how it is doing.</p>
                        <p>Take for example Wealthfront’s dashboard:</p>
                    <img ng-src="img/blogphotos/intro/wealthfront_dashboard.png" class="blogexcerpt-excerpt-body-inlineImage"/>
                        <p>The fee schedules of robo-advisors tend to be very clear, a radical departure from the complex financial planner fee schedules that often exists today. They do not have variable or hidden charges and don't make money based on commissions.</p>
                        <p>Robo-advisors are also, relatively transparent in their actions on your behalf. Given that they are run by a computer, based on some fancy algorithms, you can be sure that they are acting honestly. If something goes wrong it will be because the algorithm got it wrong, rather than because of active deception.</p>
                        <p>You should get the same comfort and service from a financial planner, but unfortunately there are some who don’t (if this is the case then you should leave them instantly).</p>
                        <h3>Investment Tax Optimisation</h3>
                        <p>Robo-advisors also offer helpful tax optimisation services. These are known as tax loss harvesting.</p>
                        <p>Whilst the execution of this is relatively complex, the underlying concept is quite clear. Tax loss harvesting involves selling stocks that you have made a loss on such that you can claim tax relief on future gains. If you want to know more, watch Wealthfront explain in their own words.</p>

                        <p>Whether this is actually that useful of a feature is a matter of debate.

                        <h2>What Are The Disadvantages Of Robo-Advise?</h2>
                        <h3>Solely Focus On Investments</h3>
                        <p>Currently, robo-advisors only help customers with investments. They are not able to assist with the other elements of personal financial management. For example, they can’t help you with insurance, estate planning, holistic tax advice or cash flow management.</p>
                        <p>This narrow focus misses a lot of what a financial planner does and can leave people significant gaps in their financial plans.</p>
                        <h3>Reliance On Your Input</h3>
                        <p>Robo-advisors make an investment strategy based on your responses to their questionnaires. For example, a common question they ask is:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>How risk averse are you?</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Most of us can’t honestly answer that off the bat. Given the importance of your responses to their solution it comes back to the old adage: “garbage in, garbage out”.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, a financial planner should have the experience and training to help you come to an honest appraisal of what your goals and levels of risk aversion really are.</p>
                        <h3>Over Emphasis On Index Based Investments</h3>
                        <p>A theoretical objection to robo-advisors is that their investment strategies are overly focused on index funds, such as the SATRIX 40. The reason for this is that their investment strategies are almost always based on the Efficient Markets Hypothesis.</p>
                        <p>We are not going to go deep into the theory here. But you should know that it is a relatively controversial hypothesis that has both its proponents and detractors. If you do want to learn more about the debate you can have a look at its <a href="//www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/04/022004.asp" class="blogexcerpt-link" target="_blank">very own Investopedia page here</a>.</p>
                        <h3>Lack Of Short-Medium Term Flexibility</h3>
                        <p>Robo-advise algorithms are based on the long-term, 20+ years. This is often mismatched with how and when people want to withdraw funds, meaning that if you want to withdraw in the short-medium term you might loose out.</p>
                        <p>Whilst most financial planners will advise that investments should be made over the long-term, if necessary they are in a better position to adjust your portfolio for short-medium term requirements.</p>
                        <h2>How Do Robo-Advise Returns Compare?</h2>
                        <p>Unfortunately, the short answer is that it is too soon to tell. Robo-advisors have only been around for about 5 years and there is not yet enough data to know.</p>
                        <p>Some early studies have contradicted each other and have drawbacks in their approach. If you do want to try and make your own assessment you can find more information at the following links.</p>

                        </ul>
                        <h2>Will The Robo-Advise Industry Be The Death Knoll For Financial Planners?</h2>
                        <h3>Financial Planners Are Here To Stay</h3>
                        <p>As it stands it is unlikely that the robo-advise industry will wipe out the need for financial planners, despite what some of the more attention grabbing headline might suggest.</p>
                        <p>Robo-advisors are not yet smart, holistic and flexible enough to displace financial planners. Not to mention that many still have reservations about leaving something as important as their financial future to a bunch of computer algorithms.</p>
                        <h3>A Convergence Of Planners And Robo-Advisors</h3>
                        <p>However, as their breakneck growth shows, robo-advisors are resonating with people. So they must be doing something right.</p>
                        <p>The most likely scenario is that the financial planning and robo-advise industries grow closer, rather than competing head-to-head. There are already many examples of financial planning firms embracing robo-advise software to improve their offering and expand their client base. Essentially giving customers the best of both worlds.</p>
                        <h3>Reduced And More Transparent Fees</h3>
                        <p>Another likely impact is that financial planners will become more transparent about their fees and reduce fees overall. Robo-advise is not the only influence here, with upcoming regulation in the form of the Retail Distribution Review (RDR) also advocating similar changes.</p>
                        <h3>A Better Deal For Customers</h3>
                        <p>Overall, there is no doubt that robo-advisors do provide value to consumers and are shaking up the financial planning industry. However, they are not yet a replacement for a financial planner.</p>
                        <p>As robo-advisors continue to improve they could get there one day, but in the short to medium term will most likely become a complementary offering to financial planners. No matter how it plays out we can be sure that all future scenarios lead to a better service for consumers.</p>
