        <p>What is the purpose of the Stock Market? How does it work and what should I know when considering investment products? This article helps to demystify financial markets.</p>
        <p>Let’s start from the beginning. What is the stock market? How does it work and why is it important?</p>
	   <p>Well, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), commonly called the Stock Market is a place where investors can buy and sell shares (stocks) to and from each other. A stock is a “share” in a company. Meaning, a company divides its ownership into lots of little bits and people can buy those bits. And yes, you can buy shares in any listed company – you can essentially become a part-owner in the company.</p>
	   
        <h3>Why Do Companies List On The Stock Market?</h3>
        <p>For a company to “list” on the JSE, they need to meet certain requirements regarding financial health and disclosures, size and other rules. The reason companies list is to raise funds to grow their businesses from the money investors pay them for shares. There are many benefits to being a listed company, but also important disclosure requirements to ensure that investors don’t get misled.</p>

    <h3>Why Does The Price Of A Stock Change?</h3>
	<p>Share prices tend to move a lot. These fluctuations can be caused by many different things but, in the long run, tend to reflect what investors think about the prospect of the company. If they think the company will make them (the owners) money, they will be willing to pay more for the share, thus sending the price of the shares higher. If they are not as excited about the prospects of the company, they will send the share price lower.</p>
    
    <h3>Why Is The Stock Market Important?</h3>
	<p>The stock market plays such an important role in South Africa because it is the engine room of the economy. It is the mechanism through which companies raise capital – the life-blood of any business. Therefore it is carefully regulated and maintained by the relevant financial authorities.</p>
    
    <h3>What Types Of Investments Can I Buy On The Stock Market?</h3>
	<p>There are other instruments listed on the JSE, besides regular company shares. These can take the form of a “thematic bundle” – namely an instrument that goes up or down based on specific factors. For example, you can buy a stock that tracks the gold price – if the gold price goes up, so does the stock and vice versa (much more convenient than buying and storing gold bars right? Not nearly as glamorous though!).</p>
    <p>Another popular type of instrument is an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). These are essentially a bundle of idividual shares that share a common characteristic, such as being in a specific industry. One of the most popular ETFs is the Satrix 40, which is a bundle of the 40 largest individual companies on the JSE. You will also hear a lot about Unit Trusts. These are pretty much the same concept as ETFs, but are not actually traded on the JSE; instead they are managed by companies, such as Allan Gray.</p>
    
    <h3>Is The Stock Market The Best Place To Put My Savings?</h3>
	<p>Historically, the stock market has produced better gains for investors over the long run. To take an example, R10 000 invested in the JSE at the start of 2009 would be worth about R25 000 today. Despite all the ups and downs, the market has been a great way for investors to diversify across many industries and sectors with liquid, diverse assets that are crucial components of any investment strategy.</p> 
    <p>When investing in the JSE, always make sure that you have a long investment horizon in mind – 10 or 20 years. This will allow you to defocus on the short term fluctuations and build your wealth (in consultation with your financial planner of course!).</p>
    
    <h3>A Word Of Warning</h3>
    <p>Investing in the stock market has historically made a lot of people a lot of money. It has also lost as many, as much. However, with a carefully calibrated investing strategy, along with guidance from a financial planner, it is an invaluable tool in any savers’ arsenal.</p>
    <p>As always though, it is crucial to tailor your investing to meet your own personal financial goals.</p>
