<p>After introducing the concept of a financial planner in our <a href="#/how-to-ensure-your-planners-not-a-scammer" class="blogexcerpt-link" target="_blank">last post</a>, we’d like to focus on a serious FAQ – can I be sure that my planner won’t mislead me, or worse, steal my hard-earned cash.</p>
        <p>If you are pressed for time, the main takeaway from this post is: DON’T DEAL WITH A PLANNER THAT DOES NOT HOLD A FAIS LICENSE.</p>
        <p>Got that? Let’s get into it.</p>
        <p>To become a financial planner, you need to have some level of training and responsibility. This shows up as credentials in the world of financial planners.</p><br>
        <p>Planner credentials generally come in two forms:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Licenses and;</li>
            <li>Qualifications</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Licenses</h3>
        <p>With regard to licenses, it is pretty simple:<br><br>DON’T DEAL WITH A PLANNER THAT DOES NOT HOLD A FAIS LICENSE.<br><br>A FAIS license means that the planner is accredited by FAIS – Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services board. FAIS is a regulatory body that functions solely to ensure that dishonest brokers and other financial intermediaries do not take advantage of customers. To become FAIS-accredited, planners need to pass exams and other assurance mechanisms on an ongoing basis. Any complaints against planners are logged through FAIS and will show up when you search for them.<br><br>You can check whether a planner currently has a FAIS license, on the FSB website: www.fsb.co.za/fais/search_fsp.htm.<br><br>Do remember that a planner’s license can be held under their companies name, so if you can’t find them specifically, search for their firm’s name and see if they are listed as a Representative or Key Individual.
    </p>
        <h3>Qualifications:</h3>
        <p>Regarding qualifications, planners earn qualifications through both written exams and on-the-job experience. Whilst there is an approximate hierarchy to the qualifications that planners hold (see below) bear in mind that not having the highest level of qualification doesn’t necessarily mean that the planner is not right for you.<br><br>Planners who are relatively new to the industry, but are very capable may not yet be eligible to take the exams. With planners such as these, make sure that they are supervised by a more experienced planner that has the highest level of qualification.<br><br>Below is a list of the qualifications recognized by the Financial Planning Institute of Southern Africa, the financial planning professional body. They are ranked based on their difficulty to obtain, with the CFP taking the most work to obtain and FSA the least:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Certified Financial Planner (CFP)</li>
            <li>Associate Financial Planner (AFP)</li>
            <li>Registered Financial Planner (RFP)</li>
            <li>Financial Services Advisor (FSA)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>The most important thing to realise though, is that there is no substitute for stellar work. Always ask your planner for references and make sure to contact them and get the scoop.<br><br>So… Financial planners can add tremendous value to your financial health and help you and your family to achieve your goals. But please keep in mind that it is crucial to do background checks on your planner and to select them from a reputable source.<br><br>If you want help finding a quality and accredited planner visit our website www.objectivemoney.co.za and be on the lookout for more posts in the future.</p>
