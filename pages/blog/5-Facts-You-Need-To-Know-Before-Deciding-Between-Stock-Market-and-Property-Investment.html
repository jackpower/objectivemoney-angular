                    <p>The following infographic compares stock market and property investing along key criteria. Below the infographic you will find more information about why they stack up that way and what it means for you.</p>

                    <h3>1)	Returns: Over The Long Run Returns Are Similar</h3>
	<p>Studies show that once all is said and done the returns of the stock market and property are very similar over the long run (20+ years).</p>
	<p>However, bear in mind that investing in the stock market can return positive results from day 1. On the other hand you will need to be paying more into a property for a number of years (probably 5+), before it starts generating cash for you.</p>
	<h3>2)	Liquidity: It Is Easier To Withdraw Your Money From The Stock Market</h3>
	<p>Stock markets are extremely liquid, meaning that it is relatively simple to take cash out whenever you want. </p>
	<p>However, properties are generally very illiquid. This means that it can be difficult to get your hands on your cash when you need it.</p>
	<h3>3)	Diversity: It Is Easier To Diversify In Stocks Than In Property</h3>
	<p>A nice thing about stocks is that it is easy to diversify. That means that you don’t need to have all of your eggs in one basket; you can easily invest in different companies, countries and commodities.</p>
	<p>On the other hand it can be difficult to diversify your property portfolio, especially if you don’t have a large amount of capital, as you need to purchase multiple houses in different areas.</p>
	<h3>4)	Volatility: Property Tends To Be Less Volatile Than Stocks</h3>
	<p>The returns on property tend to be more stable when compared against stocks. This means it is less likely that when the time comes to cash out your investment the market will be at a low and your investment might be worth less than it could be.</p>
	<p>However, this does not mean that property returns are ‘stable’. The performance of the property market is closely correlated to the performance of the stock market, but its movements are less pronounced.</p>
        <p>You can see this in the chart below, which tracks the growth of the stock market and house prices, with 2001 as the base year.</p>

	<h3>5)	Leverage: It Is Easier To Leverage A Property Than It Is A Stock</h3>
	<p>The key advantage of property is that you can easily get a loan to cover your initial investment. This means that your gains, as well as your losses, are amplified significantly.</p>
	<p>Whilst you can leverage investments in the stock market with products such as CFDs it is generally more risky, especially when combined with the volatility mentioned above.</p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Hopefully this has helped to clarify the differences between the two types of investment. This is only a basic overview and we would strongly encourage you to do some more research before making a decision either way.</p><!--Update based on post-->
