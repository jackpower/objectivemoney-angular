    <div class="row col-md-12">
        <p>After explaining in our <a href="#/choose-your-planner-like-you-would-a-friend-not-a-toothbrush">last post</a> that a planner is not a toothbrush (in any way, shape or form!), we'd like to move on to one of the most important aspects of choosing a planner – the fees. How much will you pay for the planner’s time, efforts and advice?</p>
	<p>The fees that financial planners charge can often be a murky subject and should be investigated carefully before signing up. We have done our best to simplify how fees work for the purpose of this post; however, if you want more details please do get in touch.</p>
	<p>There are broadly three types of fees that you pay when using a financial planner; these either go to the planner themselves, or to the provider of the financial product that they recommend you use (such as insurance companies, banks and other financial institutions).</p>
	<h3>1) Advise Fee</h3>
	<p>This is the fee that planners charge you for the advisory services that they provide. The most common fee structure is for planners to charge their advise fee based on the amount of money that you put through them, called Assets under Management (or AUM). This fee is typically 1% of your total Assets Under Management.</p>
	<p>However, some planners may choose to charge a retainer fee or hourly rate instead of an Asset under Management percentage. The retainer fee is generally charged monthly and should give you unlimited access to your planner. Depending on how much input you need from your planner, it may make sense to go for the retainer fee so that you know exactly how much you’ll be in for every month.</p>
	<h3>2) Commissions</h3>
	<p>A commission is the charge that you pay for getting access to the financial product being offered to you by the financial institution (Product Provider), via your planner. There are two types of commissions that you may need to pay:</p>
	<h4>2.1) Commissions To The Financial Planner:</h4>
	<p>These commissions vary by service rendered. Insurance has a legislated 3.5% commission rate included in the premiums that you pay. Although some planners may say that you don’t really pay for commissions, you do – they are deducted from the premiums you pay each month. For example, say you pay R100 per month towards a life insurance policy and the planner receives 3.5% commission from this, then in reality you are only insured for the equivalent of R96.5 per month.</p>
    <p>Investment products (like stocks) generally have a lower commission fee of 0.5% - 1% and do vary depending on the product in question. Almost all planners will earn commission on any insurance products that you take out, so you may just have to take that fee on the chin. However, not all will charge commissions on investment products; it is advisable to choose those that do not.</p>
	<h4>2.2) Commissions To The Product Provider:</h4>
	<p>These vary widely, depending on the product and should be made clear to you upfront. Generally, it is advisable to steer clear of performance fee-based products. The primary reason being that the set benchmarks that need to be beaten in order to secure the fee are often relatively easy for providers to meet. So make sure to ask your planner to give you a detailed breakdown of the fees, when you’ll pay them and whether they are fixed or variable (meaning are they set or are they subject to increase based on product performance).</p>
    <p>Don’t forget that product providers (insurers, banks etc.) can also sometimes pay commissions to financial planners when they place business with that provider. For example, for every policy from Insurer X that your planner sells you, they may be earning a direct commission from that policy provider.</p>
    <h3>3) Admin / Platform Fees</h3>
	<p>These are fees that the product providers charge for the products that they manage on your behalf. Insurance companies will generally charge between R15-R30 per month here. Again, investment products can vary widely. However, the fees are typically between 0.5-1% and you should definitely check whether this is included in your planner’s fees or not.</p>
    <h3>The Financial Flow</h3> 
    <p>Confused yet? Well we have tried to make it easier by cramming all of that information into one diagram. Remember that not all planners and products will charge fees in all of the categories below and that their rate can vary. However, as a rough rule of thumb this should help you out.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
	<p>So: fees can be complicated but you need to have a good understanding of the structure – make sure your planner tells you in plain English what fees will be charged, when and how they are structured. Remember – no surprises!</p>
