                                <p>After explaining in our <a href="#/what-fees-does-a-financial-planner-charge">last post</a> how planners charge fees, we now move to our next post which deals with how planners operate.</p>
        <p>If you're pressed for time, the most important takeaway from this post is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Independent planners will be able to sell products from any company, whereas tied planners will only sell the products of one company.</li>
            <li>Make sure that you know how much work your planner will do themselves versus someone else in their team.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Anyway, let's jump in – it’s important that you understand what goes on with your planner behind the scenes.</p>
        <h3>Independence</h3>
        <h4><i>Tied Planners</i></h4>
        <p>These are planners that only sell one company’s products. For example, Insurer X has tied planners whose sole job is simply to sell Insurer X’s investment and insurance products.</p>
        <p>Tied planners <i>may</i> be cheaper than independents, but will not be completely objective and cannot offer you the range of products that Independent planners can. If you are simply looking for a single insurance or investment product, rather than a holistic financial plan, then a tied planner could be good for you.</p>
        <h4><i>Independent Planners</i></h4>
        <p>These are planners that are not tied to any specific company and are able to place business (sell products) with any product provider.</p>
        <p>If you are looking for a planner who can help you over the long-term and provide you with a holistic view of all the products out there, then an Independent planner is the way to go. Independent planners have the benefit of being able to offer a much wider array of products than a tied planner can and can tailor them to best suit your needs.</p>
    <p>Remember though, just because a planner works for a known product provider (and has that company name on his/her business card) it does not necessarily mean that they are Tied; there are many planners who work for large organisations that are entirely independent.</p>
        <h3>Individual or Team Servicing</h3>
        <p>Whilst you may initially meet a senior member of a financial planning firm (or association) be aware that your day-to-day interaction and communication with the firm may be with one of their more junior colleagues.</p> 
        <p>This may not be a big issue for you (and may actually be better as they may have more time to devote to your financial health) but you should definitely try to get a commitment from the senior planner that they will continue to provide oversight and guidance in managing your account.</p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>So: Make sure you understand whether your planner is Independent or Tied to a specific Product Provider. Both have their advantages but it’s important that you know who you are dealing with.</p>
        <p>Secondly, just ensure that you will have adequate oversight and guidance from an experienced planner, even if a more junior team-member takes care of the day-to-day servicing of your account.</p>
